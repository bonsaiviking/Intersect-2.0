Added: Semi-interactive TCP bind shell. The shell binds to the server port 443 and accepts connects via netcat.
You can read files, make/delete folders, add user accounts, view processes, netstat, etc.
I am soon adding a new custom shell that will bind over SSL and you will have a wide variety of features, such as live sniffing
and the capability of running Intersect commands over the shell and installing add-on modules.

Madechanges to how Intersect searches for installed packages, log files and running services.
Added option to identify different Linux distro's and perform some of the searches as being specific to that distro.
Eventually I will incorporate the distro-specific searches into all the other areas.

Added support for Local exploit checker. If a non-root user runs Intersect, the script will retrieve the current Linux kernel version
and present the user with a list of local privilege escalation exploits for that kernel. The list includes the CVE number, download link
and the name of the exploit.
Added a few features to the TCP shell.

02-23-2012
Fixed Temp_Directory issue. The temporary directory is now removed unless it is specifically used by Intersect v2 to
hold reports and other data. Now you won't end up with a /tmp/ folder full of /lift-RANDOM's.
Fixed Change Directory issue in the TCP bindshell. Previously when you tried to 'cd' to a non-existant directory,
the shell would crash and cut the connection. Now we check if the directory exists, 'cd' to it if it does and if not,
we present an error message to the user stating the desired directory can not be found.
