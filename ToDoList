Intersect 2.0 To-Do List


* Implement port-scanning after live-hosts are found
* Rewrite software fingerprints and locatons for getProtection() feature
* SNMP Scanner/Enum
* Create traceroute graph for NetworkMap()
* Add search for hidden files within tarballs
* Add search for msf history files on target system
* Add search for saved Nessus scans on target system
* Add tty spy
* Fix the getGateway process. Right now, we assume you are using 192.168.1.0/24. New process will pull the gateway
  from ifconfig using your local IP, drop the last octet and add .0/24 to grab your gateway.
* Add process that dumps the plain-text from memory and sends to .txt file
* Write custom client to interact with --bind listener
  -- implement upload/download feature for client/listener
  -- allow live packet capture through remote shell
  -- implement module plugin interface to upload and execute user-defined tasks via shell
  -- convert TCP Shell to SSL wrapped TCP (for security and privacy purposes)
  -- support for multiple clients to share a remote shell for interactive team testing
* Optionally send NetworkMap() output to be imported within Metasploit DB
* Add plugin module support and provide templates for different distros and task outlines
* Add search to find kernel hardening installs
