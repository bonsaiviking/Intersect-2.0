Intersect 2.0 | Custom Interactive Shell
----------------------------------------

The contents of this folder are strictly for testing only. Don't except any of this to work 100%.
Everything that works with the regular Intersect 2.0 bind/reverse shells also works with these,
this just provides more privacy and security for any restricted data that would otherwise be transmitted in plaintext.

**Known Bug**
Sometimes when receiving data from the shell, the output will hang until the user presses [Enter]
This does not happen when running commands like 'cd', 'ls', etc but more often with receiving larger
amounts of data, such as viewing the 'helpme' menus.
If it seems like your shell has stopped responding, simply press [Enter] and the rest of the data will
be sent. Your shell is shown as "Intersect: /root $", if this does not appear after running a command,
press [Enter] once and it will appear.
I am working on the cause of this error and should have a fix out within a day or two tops.


Features:
* Full shell access (ls, pwd, cd, cat, ps, netstat, clear, etc etc)
* XOR Encryption for all data that is transmitted across the shells
* Create root user accounts on the target system via 'adduser <name>' command
* Execute Intersect2.0 tasks remotely through the shell via 'extask' command
  -- performs Intersect tasks, redirects you to report folder upon completion
  -- example: extask credentials : Gathers passwords (--credentials), cd's to /tmp/lift-*/credentials/
* Reboot remote system via 'rebootsys' command
* Enabled SSH access (coming soon)
* Download/Upload files
* Help menus for general shell usage and extask help menu
* Live packet sniffing (coming soon)


Contents:
Intersect2-XOR.py
Identical to Intersect2-Beta.py, except the reverse and bind shell uses XOR with a private key
to protect all the data that is transmitted across the shells. You are advised to edit the global variable 'pin' in this script,
xor-client.py and xor-listener.py

xor-client.py
This is the shell client that connects to Intersect2-XOR's bind-shell.

xor-listener.py
This is the shell listener that waits for and accepts connections from the Intersect2-XOR reverse-shell.
